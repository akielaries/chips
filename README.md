# Intro
A work in progress, early stage implementation of several pieces that
makeup a computer using electronic components done in my freetime in between work, projects and openGPMP. 
Making using of Verilog, SystemVerilog, and open source tools for compilation and analysis. 

# Progress
From scratch with ICs or crystals:
* Dual input logic gates using transistors and resistors.
* Created 555 timer & Oscillator, 3.25Hz @9V.

# Tools
* [iverilog](https://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog) & [verilator](https://github.com/verilator/verilator): compiling
Verilog and SystemVerilog implementations and test benches into binaries.
* [GTKWave](https://github.com/gtkwave/gtkwave): visualizing signals
and running simulations.
* [cocotb](https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb): generating tedious test benches.
* [yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys): synthesis and tests with
generating schematics.
* [KiCad](https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad): creating schematics.
